IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL:
{: .fs-5 .text-red-200 .fw-500}

1. **Only operate your MBot on the floor.** When your MBot is on a table, put it in a box to make sure it doesn't accidentally drive away and zip off the table!
2. DO NOT run `sudo apt-get update` on the MBot.
3. Each STUDENT will build their own MBot that they are solely responsible for returning in full functioning condition at the end of the semester.
    - If you believe your MBot is broken, talk with the GSIs for help repairing or replacing parts.
    - Donâ€™t make changes without approval from the course staff. Undo any (approved) changes before you return them.

Failure to adhere to these warnings may result in a penalty to your grade.

*We have a limited number of working robots; thus, proper care is highly critical!*
