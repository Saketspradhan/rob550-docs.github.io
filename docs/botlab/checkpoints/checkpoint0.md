IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL: 
{: .fs-5 .text-red-200 .fw-500} 

1. **Only operate your MBot on the floor.** When your MBot is on a table, put it in a box to make sure it doesn't accidentally drive away and zip off the table!
2. DO NOT run 'sudo apt-get update' on the MBot.
3. Each STUDENT will build their own MBot that they are solely responsible for returning in full functioning condition at the end of the semester. 
    - If you believe your MBot is broken, talk with the GSIs for help repairing or replacing parts.
    - Donâ€™t make changes without approval from the course staff. Undo any (approved) changes before you return them.

Failure to adhere to these warnings may result in a penalty to your grade.

*We have a limited number of working robots; thus, proper care is highly critical!*

## Assembly and Setup
### Task 0.1 Assembly
Following the instruction in the [assembly guide](/docs/botlab/setup-guide/mbot-classic-assemly) and assemble your robot.

### Task 0.2 Software Setup
Following the instructions in the [mbot system setup guide](/docs/botlab/setup-guide/mbot-system-setup) and setup the software on your robot.

### Task 0.3 Gripper Design 
Objective: Design and construct a target lifting mechanism for your MBot. This is an iterative process, so start the project early and continuously refine your design.

Resources: Utilize the tools and materials available at the Makerspace. Remember, the key to success is experimentation and regular improvement.

Team Strategy: Each team member's robot does not need to have a unique gripper. However, for the final challenge, consider the benefits of equipping each robot with a mechanism. This could be the team's best design applied to all available robots, or employing different strategic approaches for each robot.

Documentation: Ensure you document your gripper design. This includes **detailed drawings, a Bill of Materials (BOM), and step-by-step construction instructions**.
