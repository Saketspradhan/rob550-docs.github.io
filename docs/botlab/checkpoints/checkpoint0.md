IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL: 
{: .fs-5 .text-red-200 .fw-500} 

1. **Only operate your MBot on the floor.** When your MBot is on a table, put it in a box to make sure it doesn't accidentally drive away and zip off the table!
2. DO NOT run 'sudo apt-get update' on the MBot.
3. Each STUDENT will build their own MBot that they are solely responsible for returning in full functioning condition at the end of the semester. 
    - If you believe your MBot is broken, talk with the GSIs for help repairing or replacing parts.
    - Don’t make changes without approval from the course staff. Undo any (approved) changes before you return them.

Failure to adhere to these warnings may result in a penalty to your grade.

*We have a limited number of working robots; thus, proper care is highly critical!*

## Assembly and Setup
### Task 0.1 Assembly
Following the instruction in the [assembly guide](/docs/botlab/setup-guide/mbot-classic-assemly) and assemble your robot.

### Task 0.2 Software Setup
Following the instructions in the [mbot system setup guide](/docs/botlab/setup-guide/mbot-system-setup) and setup the software on your robot.

### Task 0.3 Design Lab 
The main development goal of BotLab is to finish the [final competition](/docs/botlab/checkpoints/competition). One part of this competition involves target lifting, where you need to design and build a lifting mechanism for your MBot, for exmaple, make mbot a forklift.

There are 3D printers available in both the lab and the Makerspace that you can use to create your design.

In the competition, you don’t need a unique gripper for each team member’s robot. You can use the team’s best design for all robots or try different strategic approaches for each one. Remember, designing such a mechanism is an iterative process, so start the project early and continue refining your design.

{: .required_for_report }
Ensure you document your gripper design which includes: <br> 1) Detailed drawings <br> 2) Bill of Materials (BOM) <br> 3) Step-by-step construction instructions


## Checkpoint Submission
No submission is required for this checkpoint. 

After completing Checkpoint 0, you should have a functional mbot ready for development and a basic understanding of the ultimate development goal – the final competition.
