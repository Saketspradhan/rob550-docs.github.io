### Event 1: Pick ‘n sort! (300 points)
Based on your selected level, specific blocks (cubes) will be placed on the positive half-plane and in front of the robotic arm:
- Level 1 - 3 large blocks (R G and B), not stacked
- Level 2 - 6 blocks, 3 of each size, random colors (ROYGBV), not stacked
- Level 3 - 9 blocks, random sizes, random colors (ROYGBV), possibly stacked two high

Your team's task is to:
- Choose one level for completion.
- Complete the task within 180 seconds.
- Sort small blocks to the left and large ones to the right of the arm.

Points:
- +30 points for each block picked and dropped correctly
- +(10 * level) points for completing the task in the time allotted
- 50% deduction for using “click” for each pick-and-place instead of an autonomous approach

### Event 3: Line ‘em up! (400 points)

### Event 4: Stack ‘em high! (500 points)
