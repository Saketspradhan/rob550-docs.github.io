## Assemble the jumper wires

| Components     | #         | 
|:-------------|:-----------|
| jumper wires (Black/Red/Yellow/Blue/Green/White)   |6| 
| Crimp connector housings (3/4/6 pins)   |3| 

You need to build the OLED/Bootload cable assembly which is shown. This cable plugs into the Jetson or RasPi 40pin header, the OLED module, and the Control board and allows both communicating with the OLED and controlling the run and bootload modes on the control board.

Gather the components listed in the table and ensure you have all the items shown in the image below. Assemble a 3-heads wire as depicted in the second image. **Color and order matters!** Your assembled wire should look exactly like the image indicated.
